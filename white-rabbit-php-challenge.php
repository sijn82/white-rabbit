// I need to create an anagram solver to select the right combination of words from a list of options.

//----- Task -----//

// You've made an important decision. Now, let's get to the matter.

// We have a message for you. But we hid it.
// Unless you know the secret phrase, it will remain hidden.

// Can you write the algorithm to find it?


//----- Clues -----//

// Here's a couple of important hints to help you out:

// - An anagram of the phrase is: "poultry outwits ants"

// - There are three levels of difficulty to try your skills with
// - The MD5 hash of the easiest secret phrase is "e4820b45d2277f3844eac66c903e84be"
// - The MD5 hash of the more difficult secret phrase is "23170acc097c24edb98fc5488ab033fe"
// - The MD5 hash of the hard secret phrase is "665e5bcb0c20062fe8abaaf4628bb154"


//----- Experiment -----//

// The list of words includes words not possible within the anagram.  
// So I should remove any of those from the list which can't be right.



// I need to run through the list of words,
